# **Hotel Reservation System**
<br/>

## About this project

This demo project represents an example of a hotel reservation system developed using Spring Boot, GraphQL, and Java 17.

It provides a streamlined GraphQL API designed to accommodate two user roles, each with specific request capabilities.

**Hotel administrators:**
- Manage rooms â€“ view / add / remove / edit
- See schedule for each room
- See hotel availability statistics (how many rooms are free/busy) for specified period

**Customers:**
- Check availability on specified period
- Make a reservation
<br/>
